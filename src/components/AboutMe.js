    <p>
    Hi, I&apos;m <span>Gabby Ortman</span>. I&apos;m currently a software engineer at <a href="https://www.storable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Storable</a> (formerly <span>Red Nova Labs</span>) primarily working with JavaScript and contribute to both the frontend and backend on a full-remote team. Notably, I work on the team that launched the revamp of StorageMart's new <a href="https://www.storage-mart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a> and website builder. When I&apos;m not working with JavaScript, I may be contributing to other repositories built with Ruby on Rails or Angular or other hip 2010s web development technologies.

    During normal circumstances, you might find me attending conferences, grimacing at my computer in local coffee shops, running, and spoiling my dog, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/antoninus.pius.dog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pius</a>, and rabbit, <span>Smalls</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, you&apos;ll probably find me running, ordering an iced mocha to-go from either Monarch or Broadway Coffee, terraforming my animal crossing island, camping, and walking Pius around the neighborhood.

      I studied computer science at <span>Iowa State University</span> and graduated in 2017. While there, I kept myself busy running <a href="http://digitalwomen.ece.iastate.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Women</a>, acting as a student liason on the <a href="https://www.cs.iastate.edu/student-advisory-council" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Computer Science Student Advisory Council</a>, participating in <span>hackathons</span>, and volunteering at STEM events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before <span>Storable</span>, I did three software engineering internships in Kansas City.

      If you want to chat about my dog, the bugs I've personally introduced at work, why I'm not using <em>[really cool webpack plugin]</em> on my website, or need a recommendation on where to get coffee in Midtown/Westport, Kansas City, feel free to contact me on <a href="https://keybase.io/gabbyortman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Keybase</a> or by <a href="mailto:hi@gabbyortman.com">email</a>.

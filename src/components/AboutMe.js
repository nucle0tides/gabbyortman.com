    <p>
      Hi, I'm <span>Gabby Ortman</span>. I'm currently a software engineer at <a href="https://www.storable.com/">Storable</a> (formerly <span>Red Nova Labs</span>) primarily working in a JavaScript-centered stack and contribute to both the frontend and backend. When I'm not working with JavaScript, I may be contributing to other repositories with Ruby on Rails or Angular or other hip 2010s web development technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
      During normal circumstances, you might find me attending conferences, grimacing at my computer in local coffee shops, running, and spoiling my dog, <span>Pius</span>, and rabbit, <span>Smalls</span>.
      <br />
      Currently, you'll likely find me running, ordering an iced mocha to-go from either Monarch or Broadway Coffee, terraforming my animal crossing island, camping, and walking my dog around the neighborhood.
    </p>

    <p>
      I studied computer science at <span>Iowa State University</span> and graduated in 2017. While there, I kept myself busy running <a href="http://digitalwomen.ece.iastate.edu/">Digital Women</a>, acting as a student liason on the <span>Computer Science Student Advisory Council</span>, participating in <span>hackathons</span>, and volunteering at STEM events.
        <br />
        <br />
      Before <span>Storable</span>, I did three software engineering internships in Kansas City and one NSF REU at Iowa State University.

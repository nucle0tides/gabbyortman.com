    <p>
      Hi, I&apos;m <span>Gabby Ortman</span>. I&apos;m currently a software engineer at <a href="https://www.storable.com/">Storable</a> (formerly <span>Red Nova Labs</span>) primarily working in a JavaScript-centered stack and contribute to both the frontend and backend. When I&apos;m not working with JavaScript, I may be contributing to other repositories with Ruby on Rails or Angular or other hip 2010s web development technologies.

      During normal circumstances, you might find me attending conferences, grimacing at my computer in local coffee shops, running, and spoiling my dog, <span>Pius</span>, and rabbit, <span>Smalls</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, you&apos;ll likely find me running, ordering an iced mocha to-go from either Monarch or Broadway Coffee, terraforming my animal crossing island, camping, and walking my dog around the neighborhood.
    </p>

      I studied computer science at <span>Iowa State University</span> and graduated in 2017. While there, I kept myself busy running <a href="http://digitalwomen.ece.iastate.edu/">Digital Women</a>, acting as a student liason on the <span>Computer Science Student Advisory Council</span>, participating in <span>hackathons</span>, and volunteering at STEM events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before <span>Storable</span>, I did three software engineering internships in Kansas City and one NSF REU at Iowa State University.

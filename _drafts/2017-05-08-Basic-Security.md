You know better, you really do. Even your dog knows you know better, and yet, you did it anyways. You resued a password. Better yet, you reused a password that was in a [Neopets data breach](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/neopets-hack-another-day-another-hack-tens-of-millions-of-neopets-accounts) that was discovered just this last year. You resued a password and now your childhood obsession with Neopets is hurting you in more ways than one. Your ex-boyfriend that also happens to be a programmer took the time to get this password dump and get into your Twitter account, just to spy on your Twitter activity and mess with your flawless, but uninsured Twitter fame. 

I will say, however, this is not your fault. Your ex-boyfriend that also happens to be a programmer kno ws it's wrong to gain unauthorized access to your online accounts. It happens to the best of us, though. Even everyone's favorite Adidas sandals-wearing, AI-building, unofficial presidential-candidate hopeful CEO has had his [accounts hacked](https://www.forbes.com/sites/civicnation/2017/03/31/i-proudly-work-in-the-womens-movement-heres-why/#223eed071f58). In 2007, Dinei Florencio and Cormac Herley at Microsoft Research found, in a [three month study with half a million participants](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/www2007.pdf), that the average user has "6.5 passwords, each of which is shared across 3.9 different sites." Furthermore, the average password bit strength was ~40.54 bits (i.e., not _that_ strong). They also found sites like the NYTimes all had weaker passwords by choice, compared to websites that required users to pick a strong password. Keep in mind, they were also looking at ancient relics like AOL and Myspace at the time. Facebook wouldn't open up to the general public until September 2006 and Twitter did not exist until March 2006. This is not even taking any of the recent security breaches within large firms into account. You're not alone in this, and it's not too late to better protect yourself from the wild wild west of the internet, or more importantly, your ex-boyfriend that also happens to be a programmer.

Luckily, you at least had login alerts set up, so you received the email that _someone_ (I wonder who) had logged into your Twitter account, in same town as you, but on a browser you do not use. 

You and your ex-boyfriend that also happens to be a programmer are no longer speaking. However, there is nothing (perhaps other than an Equal Opportunity investigation that took 179 days to complete, or maybe a sense of self worth) stopping him from continuing to get unauthorized access to your online accounts. How can you stop him, or, at the very least, slow him? 

### 1. Change All of Your Passwords 

1. Do Not Reuse Passwords 

	This...this is a given. You learned the hard way, and now you better stick to it this time. 

2. Make Your Passwords **Strong**

	You learned this when you were setting up your first Neopets.com account. Common words or phrases like "password," "hi," or "i love my guinea pig unconditionally" are not strong candidates for passwords. Other things like, your guinea pig's name, your birthday, or other information attributed to you do not make strong candidates for passwords either. 

3. Store Your Passwords in a Safe Space 

	The days of writing your important <sub>(Neopets)</sub> passwords in your mother's check balancing books are over. Several password managers, free, paid, and open source have popped up, offering a reprieve from the mental and physical toll of having to remember countless passwords (you know, at most 5 base passwords with slight variations). Some have mobile counterparts. Some will automatically sync changes for you. All have their pros and cons.

	* [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/)

### 2. Two-Factor Authentication

You meant to set this up a while ago. Similar to how you told your mom you were _just_ about to set up an optometrist appointment while you were away for school. 

* Via Text
	Once you enable 2FA via text message on an account, after entering your username and password, a 6 digit code will be sent to your phone, and you will be prompted to enter that code before finishing the login process. This, however, has its own vulnerabilities. 

* Via App
	If 2FA via text message is not feasible for you

* YubiKey
	If the aforementioned are not enough for you, and you'd rather be buried with your 2FA so you have it in the afterlife as if you were an Egyptian Pharoh, there's a USB drive for that. YubiKey is a little USB device that enables users to add another layer of security to their online data. It uses the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) authentication standard developed by Google and Yubico.

### 3. Check and Clear Your Active Sessions on Your Accounts 

This is easily done for all of your favorite accounts. For example, you can view which devices you are logged in with, when these accounts were last accessed, where these accounts were last accessed, and which browser and operating system these accounts were accessed with. 

You can find your active Facebook sessions under 'Settings' > 'Security' > 'Where You're Logged In.' 

Here's what my active sessions currently look like: 

![Facebook Sessions]({{ site.url }}/assets/facebook_sessions.png)

End any of these sessions that either seem suspicious, or ones you cannot quite remember creating yourself. If you do see sessions that cannot possibly be you, change your password too. 

### 4. Use a VPN 

Hoo boy, you thought changing your passwords, setting up 2FA, and clearing your sessions was enough, but you were _wrong_. As it turns out, your ex-boyfriend that also happens to be a programmer decided exploit the fact that you two lived across the hall from each other and have classes together, and therefore are on the same network for a large period of time by downloading Wireshark and doing some investigative packet sniffing. Luckily, VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) are here for you. VPNs have several use cases including: accessing your school or work's intranet, encrypting your internet traffic while on a public network (cafe, airport, etc), torrenting _legal_ content, 

### 5. Save Yourself the Time, Hassle, and Headaches by Not Dating A Programmer. 

So the Office of Equal Opportunity botched their investigation. Sad! You already knew your pile of evidence was never going to be enough anyways. It's.......................okay though. 

Find yourself a nice, somewhat technologically-illiterate boy. You'll be have plenty in common, like going outside. Besides, you'll be making enough money for the both of you. <sub><sub>Will I heed my own advice? Hahahahha idk man.</sub></sub>
